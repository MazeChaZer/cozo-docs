Cozo database documentation
=====================================

Welcome to the documentation for CozoDB,
a feature-rich, transactional, time-travel-enabled, relational-graph-vector database that uses Datalog for queries,
while making no performance compromises.

You can start immediately with the :doc:`tutorial`, which you can follow without installing anything.

For installation instructions and language-specific APIs, 
please refer to the `GitHub page <https://github.com/cozodb/cozo>`_.
