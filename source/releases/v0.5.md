# Cozo 0.5: the versatile embeddable graph database with Datalog is half-way 1.0

It's been a quarter of a year since Cozo's initial release and today we are glad to present to you the "half-way 1.0" version.
This marks the completion of all the features we envisaged for Cozo when we first started but weren't present in the initial release:

* User-defined fixed rules (added in v0.5)
* Callbacks for mutation (added in v0.5)
* Multi-statement transaction (added in v0.5)
* Indices (added in v0.5)
* Imperative mini-language (added in v0.5)
* Time-travelling (added in v0.4)
* Swappable backend (added in v0.2)

In addition, v0.5 brings major behind-the-scene changes that has big performance benefits:

* The semi-naive algorithm for executing queries is now executed in parallel for each Horn-clause (now it is even more advisable to split your queries into smaller pieces--better readability *and* performance!)
* The evaluation of expressions is no longer interpreted but instead through stack-based bytecodes (a few percent improvements for filter-heavy queries--the improvement mainly comes from the avoidance of memory allocations)

From now on, until version 1.0, development will "shift-gear" to focus on:

* stability
* performance
* interoperability with other software, e.g.:
    * [networkx](https://networkx.org/) for pythonic in-memory graph analytics
    * [PyG](https://www.pyg.org/) in particular and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) in general for deep learning on graphs
    * [plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/) and [dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) for plotting and dashboards

If you find Cozo to be useful in your work, please send us feedbacks so that we can make Cozo better still!
